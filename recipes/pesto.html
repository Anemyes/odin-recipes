        <h3><p>Description</p></h3>
        <p>Pesto, or Pesto alla Genovese, is a sauce originating in Genoa, the capital city of Liguria, Italy. It traditionally consists of crushed garlic, European pine nuts, coarse salt, basil leaves, and hard cheese such as Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Sardo, all blended with olive oil.</p>

                <li>2 garlic, or more to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
                <li>1 bunch fresh basil leaves</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons grated Pecorino romano cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            </ul>

        <h3><p>Steps</p></h3>

                <li>Crush garlic using a mortar and pestle</li>
                <li>Add pine nuts; crush with the garlic</li>
                <li>Add basil leaves gradually, making circular movements with the pestle, until a smooth paste forms</li>
                <li>Mix Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and Pecorino romano chesse using a wooden spoon</li>
                <li>Stir in olive oil until pesto is blend</li>

        <h3><p>Notes</p></h3>   
            <p>If you don't have a pestle and mortar, you can also use a food processor or blender. Chill the blade and container in the fridge for 1 hour and the process in pulses to avoid heating the pesto mixture. Add basil, pine nuts, and garlic in 3 batches, then follow with the cheese and the oil as above.</p>
